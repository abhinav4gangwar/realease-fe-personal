          <p className="text-sm text-[#4E4F54]">
            5.1. Our Commitment to Security: We are committed to protecting the
            confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Your Customer Data.
            We implement and maintain a comprehensive security program with
            robust administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed
            to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration,
            or destruction of Your data, in accordance with the Information
            Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and
            Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. While our
            security measures are constantly evolving, they include the
            following controls: (a) Access Control and Authentication Secure
            Authentication: We use modern, token-based authentication protocols
            (like JWT) to secure user sessions and prevent unauthorized account
            access. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): The Service enforces
            granular, role-based permissions to ensure users can only access the
            data and features appropriate for their assigned role (e.g., admin,
            collaborator, viewer). Brute-Force and Bot Protection: We implement
            rate limiting, Captcha technology (like Google's reCAPTCHA), and
            other protective measures on authentication endpoints to mitigate
            brute-force attacks and block malicious bot activity. (b) Data
            Encryption and Protection Encryption in Transit: All data
            transmitted between you and our Services is encrypted using
            industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.2 or higher), and
            all non-secure (HTTP) connections are redirected to secure (HTTPS)
            connections. Encryption at Rest: Sensitive data stored in our
            databases, such as passwords and access tokens, is encrypted at rest
            using strong cryptographic algorithms (like AES-256). Payment
            Security: We do not store your full payment card information on our
            systems. All payment processing is handled by our PCI DSS compliant
            third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay). (c)
            Application and Infrastructure Security Threat Prevention: Our
            application is developed with safeguards against common web
            vulnerabilities, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site
            Request Forgery (CSRF), and SQL Injection (SQLi), through measures
            like input sanitization and parameterized queries. Secure
            Infrastructure: Our platform is hosted on leading cloud
            infrastructure providers (like Amazon Web Services) that maintain
            certified, secure environments. Access to our production environment
            is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel. Secrets
            Management: All sensitive credentials, such as API keys and
            application secrets, are securely managed and are never exposed in
            client-side code. (d) Backup and Disaster Recovery Automated
            Backups: We perform regular, automated, and encrypted backups of
            Your Customer Data to prevent data loss and ensure timely recovery.
            Data Resiliency: We use measures such as file versioning for
            user-uploaded documents to protect against accidental deletion or
            modification. Audit Logging: We maintain audit logs to track
            critical system events, access patterns, and administrative actions
            to assist in security analysis and incident response.{' '}
